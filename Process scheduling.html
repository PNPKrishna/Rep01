    <p class="w3-opacity"><i><b>The act of determining which process is in the ready state, and should be moved to the running state is known as Process Scheduling.</b></i></p>
    <p class="w3-justify">The prime aim of the process scheduling system is to keep the CPU busy all the time and to deliver minimum response time for all programs. <br>  For achieving this, the scheduler must apply appropriate rules for swapping processes <b>IN</b> and <b>OUT</b> of CPU.<br><br>Scheduling fell into one of the two general categories:<br><br><b>Non Pre-emptive Scheduling:</b><br>When the currently executing process gives up the CPU voluntarily.<br><b>Pre-emptive Scheduling:</b><br> When the operating system decides to favour another process, pre-empting the currently executing process.</p>
